Andy Jassy: Good morning everyone. Today is November 15th, 2024. This is our Q4 planning meeting to finalize Prime Day 2025 strategy, AWS enterprise expansion, and Alexa device roadmap. We need to make critical decisions on budget allocation and resource planning.

Sarah: Thanks Andy. The purpose today is to align on three major initiatives: Prime Day 2025 preparation, AWS enterprise customer acquisition strategy, and next-generation Alexa device development. We need go/no-go decisions and clear ownership assignments.

Dave: From AWS engineering, the enterprise migration tools are 90% complete. We can launch the enterprise onboarding platform by February 15th if we prioritize it. If we add the advanced analytics dashboard, we're looking at March 1st. The Alexa voice recognition improvements need another six weeks of development and testing.

Patricia: Operations can support Prime Day 2025 launch on July 15th. We have fulfillment centers ready and logistics teams trained. For AWS enterprise onboarding, we need to coordinate with our top 50 enterprise customers on migration timelines. The Alexa device launch will require new manufacturing partnerships.

Brian: Sales has five enterprise deals pending that depend on the AWS enterprise platform. If we delay beyond February 1st, we risk losing two of them worth $2.5M annually. Prime Day is critical for our retail segment. The Alexa device is a must-have for our smart home ecosystem expansion.

Rachel: Marketing has campaigns ready for Prime Day 2025. We can pivot to AWS enterprise messaging if needed. The Alexa device needs positioning work - we're calling it "Alexa Pro" but that might conflict with existing product names.

David: Legal flagged that the AWS enterprise platform's data handling needs GDPR and CCPA compliance review. That could add 3-4 weeks. Prime Day terms are already approved. Alexa device - we need to review voice data retention policies for the new storage requirements.

Tom: Finance ran the numbers. Prime Day 2025 marketing costs $15M in additional spend. AWS enterprise platform requires $8M for customer migration support and infrastructure. Alexa device manufacturing adds $25M in capital expenditure. Our Q4 budget has $35M allocated, so we can do two of three, not all three.

Andy Jassy: Let's decide. Sarah, what's your recommendation?

Sarah: I recommend we prioritize AWS enterprise platform for February 1st to secure the enterprise deals. Defer Prime Day to July 20th to allow more preparation time. Push Alexa device to Q2 2025 to stay within budget and ensure quality.

Dave: Engineering agrees. We can deliver AWS enterprise platform by February 1st. Prime Day by July 20th is doable with the extra time. Alexa device in Q2 gives us time to perfect the voice recognition and manufacturing processes.

Patricia: Operations is aligned. We'll focus on AWS enterprise customer onboarding first, then shift to Prime Day logistics prep.

Brian: Sales supports this. The $2.5M in enterprise deals is critical. We can manage Prime Day expectations with retail customers.

Rachel: Marketing will pivot campaigns to AWS enterprise launch. We'll soft-launch Prime Day messaging in June.

David: Legal will expedite compliance review for AWS platform. Prime Day is already cleared.

Tom: Finance approves. This keeps us within the $35M budget - $8M for AWS enterprise, $15M for Prime Day marketing, and we defer the $25M Alexa device cost.

Andy Jassy: Decision made. AWS enterprise platform launches February 1st. Prime Day launches July 20th. Alexa device moves to Q2 2025. Action items: Sarah finalizes AWS enterprise documentation by December 20th. Dave completes Prime Day technical infrastructure by June 1st. Patricia coordinates enterprise customer migrations starting January 15th. Brian closes the $2.5M enterprise deals by January 31st. Rachel updates all marketing materials by December 15th. David completes compliance review by January 15th. Tom provides updated Q4 budget forecast by December 10th.

Sarah: I'll have the AWS enterprise documentation ready by December 20th and share it with engineering and sales teams.

Dave: Prime Day technical infrastructure will be done by June 1st. I'll provide weekly status updates every Friday.

Patricia: I'll start reaching out to enterprise customers on January 15th to schedule migrations. Target completion by February 10th.

Brian: I'm confident we can close the $2.5M enterprise deals by January 31st. I'll send daily updates to Andy.

Rachel: Marketing materials will be updated by December 15th. I'll coordinate with Brian on customer-facing messaging.

David: Compliance review will be completed by January 15th. I'll flag any issues immediately.

Tom: Updated budget forecast will be ready by December 10th. I'll include risk scenarios for potential cost overruns.

Andy Jassy: Open questions: What happens if the $2.5M enterprise deals don't close by January 31st? Do we still proceed with AWS enterprise platform launch? Also, what's our backup plan if Prime Day logistics have capacity issues?

Sarah: If the deals don't close, we should still launch AWS enterprise platform on schedule. The other three enterprise deals are still valuable. For Prime Day, if logistics have issues, we can scale back to core markets and expand gradually.

Dave: I agree. AWS enterprise platform launch shouldn't be contingent on one deal. For Prime Day, we have redundancy in our fulfillment network - if one region has issues, others can compensate.

Andy Jassy: Risks I'm seeing: First, if we miss the February 1st AWS enterprise deadline, we lose all five enterprise deals. Second, Prime Day delay beyond July 20th impacts our Q3 revenue targets significantly. Third, the Alexa device deferral might cause customer churn in our smart home ecosystem.

Sarah: Those are valid concerns. I'll add weekly checkpoints to track AWS enterprise progress. For Prime Day, we can add buffer time. Alexa device - we should communicate the Q2 timeline proactively to smart home customers.

Tom: The revenue impact of losing those enterprise deals would be $5M annually. That's significant. We need to treat AWS enterprise platform as mission-critical.

Andy Jassy: Agreed. Let's add a weekly AWS enterprise status meeting every Monday at 9am. Sarah, you'll own that. Also, let's set up a risk dashboard that Dave updates daily.

Dave: I can do daily updates. The risk dashboard will track: AWS enterprise completion percentage, Prime Day infrastructure progress, and any blockers.

Andy Jassy: Important context for why we're making these tradeoffs: We're prioritizing revenue protection ($2.5M+ enterprise deals) over feature completeness. The Prime Day delay allows us to ship a better customer experience. Alexa device deferral keeps us within budget while maintaining engineering capacity for the other two initiatives.

Sarah: The rationale is sound. We're making data-driven decisions based on revenue impact and technical feasibility.

Andy Jassy: Key metrics to track: AWS enterprise migration completion rate target is 85% by February 15th. Prime Day customer acquisition - we want 50,000 new Prime members by July 25th. Q4 revenue target is $150M, which these initiatives support.

Tom: I'll track these metrics weekly and report in our Monday meetings.

Andy Jassy: Follow-up: Next check-in is Monday December 10th at 9am. We'll review AWS enterprise progress, budget forecast, and risk dashboard. After that, weekly Monday meetings until AWS enterprise platform launch.

Sarah: Sounds good. I'll send calendar invites and prep materials by end of day today.

Andy Jassy: Perfect. Meeting adjourned.
