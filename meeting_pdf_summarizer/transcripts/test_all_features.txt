Carter: Good morning everyone. Today is March 15th, 2024. This is our Q2 planning meeting to finalize the product roadmap and budget allocation for the next quarter.

James: Thanks Carter. The purpose today is to align on three major initiatives: the mobile app launch, the API v2 rollout, and the new analytics dashboard. We need to make go/no-go decisions on each and assign clear ownership.

Theo: From engineering, the mobile app is 85% complete. We can ship by April 30th if we cut the offline sync feature. If we keep it, we're looking at May 15th. The API v2 is ready for beta testing now, but we need two weeks for documentation. The analytics dashboard needs another month of development.

Olivia: Operations can support the mobile app launch on April 30th. We have the support team trained and runbooks ready. For API v2, we need to coordinate with our enterprise customers on migration timelines. The analytics dashboard will require new infrastructure provisioning.

Sam: Sales has three enterprise deals pending that depend on API v2. If we delay beyond April 1st, we risk losing one of them worth $500K annually. The mobile app is nice-to-have for our SMB segment, but not critical. The analytics dashboard is a must-have for our enterprise tier.

Bobby: Marketing has campaigns ready for mobile app launch. We can pivot to API v2 messaging if needed. The analytics dashboard needs positioning work - we're calling it "Business Intelligence Suite" but that might be too generic.

Lena: Legal flagged that the mobile app's data collection needs GDPR compliance review. That could add 2-3 weeks. API v2 terms are already approved. Analytics dashboard - we need to review data retention policies for the new storage requirements.

Priya: Finance ran the numbers. Mobile app launch costs $50K in additional marketing spend. API v2 requires $30K for customer migration support. Analytics dashboard infrastructure adds $75K quarterly. Our Q2 budget has $120K allocated, so we can do two of three, not all three.

Carter: Let's decide. James, what's your recommendation?

James: I recommend we prioritize API v2 for April 1st to secure the enterprise deals. Defer mobile app to May 15th with offline sync - the extra time is worth it. Push analytics dashboard to Q3 to stay within budget.

Theo: Engineering agrees. We can deliver API v2 by April 1st. Mobile app by May 15th is doable. Analytics dashboard in Q3 gives us time to do it right.

Olivia: Operations is aligned. We'll focus on API v2 migration support first, then shift to mobile app prep.

Sam: Sales supports this. The $500K deal is critical. We can manage mobile app expectations with customers.

Bobby: Marketing will pivot campaigns to API v2 launch. We'll soft-launch mobile app messaging in May.

Lena: Legal will expedite GDPR review for mobile app. API v2 is already cleared.

Priya: Finance approves. This keeps us within the $120K budget - $30K for API v2, $50K for mobile app marketing, and we defer the $75K analytics dashboard cost.

Carter: Decision made. API v2 launches April 1st. Mobile app launches May 15th with offline sync. Analytics dashboard moves to Q3. Action items: James finalizes API v2 documentation by March 22nd. Theo completes mobile app offline sync by May 1st. Olivia coordinates enterprise customer migrations starting March 25th. Sam closes the $500K deal by March 31st. Bobby updates all marketing materials by March 20th. Lena completes GDPR review by April 15th. Priya provides updated Q2 budget forecast by March 18th.

James: I'll have the API v2 documentation ready by March 22nd and share it with engineering and sales.

Theo: Mobile app offline sync will be done by May 1st. I'll provide weekly status updates every Friday.

Olivia: I'll start reaching out to enterprise customers on March 25th to schedule migrations. Target completion by April 10th.

Sam: I'm confident we can close the $500K deal by March 31st. I'll send daily updates to Carter.

Bobby: Marketing materials will be updated by March 20th. I'll coordinate with Sam on customer-facing messaging.

Lena: GDPR review will be completed by April 15th. I'll flag any issues immediately.

Priya: Updated budget forecast will be ready by March 18th. I'll include risk scenarios for potential cost overruns.

Carter: Open questions: What happens if the $500K deal doesn't close by March 31st? Do we still proceed with API v2 launch? Also, what's our backup plan if mobile app offline sync has technical issues?

James: If the deal doesn't close, we should still launch API v2 on schedule. The other two enterprise deals are still valuable. For mobile app, if offline sync has issues, we can ship without it and add it in a patch.

Theo: I agree. API v2 launch shouldn't be contingent on one deal. For mobile app, offline sync is isolated code - if it fails, the rest of the app works fine.

Carter: Risks I'm seeing: First, if we miss the April 1st API v2 deadline, we lose all three enterprise deals. Second, mobile app delay beyond May 15th impacts our Q2 revenue targets. Third, the analytics dashboard deferral might cause customer churn in enterprise tier.

James: Those are valid concerns. I'll add weekly checkpoints to track API v2 progress. For mobile app, we can add buffer time. Analytics dashboard - we should communicate the Q3 timeline proactively to enterprise customers.

Priya: The revenue impact of losing those deals would be $1.2M annually. That's significant. We need to treat API v2 as mission-critical.

Carter: Agreed. Let's add a weekly API v2 status meeting every Monday at 9am. James, you'll own that. Also, let's set up a risk dashboard that Theo updates daily.

Theo: I can do daily updates. The risk dashboard will track: API v2 completion percentage, mobile app offline sync progress, and any blockers.

Carter: Important context for why we're making these tradeoffs: We're prioritizing revenue protection ($500K+ deals) over feature completeness. The mobile app delay allows us to ship a better product. Analytics dashboard deferral keeps us within budget while maintaining engineering capacity for the other two initiatives.

James: The rationale is sound. We're making data-driven decisions based on revenue impact and technical feasibility.

Carter: Key metrics to track: API v2 migration completion rate target is 80% by April 15th. Mobile app beta signups - we want 1,000 by May 1st. Q2 revenue target is $2.5M, which these initiatives support.

Priya: I'll track these metrics weekly and report in our Monday meetings.

Carter: Follow-up: Next check-in is Monday March 18th at 9am. We'll review API v2 progress, budget forecast, and risk dashboard. After that, weekly Monday meetings until API v2 launch.

James: Sounds good. I'll send calendar invites and prep materials by end of day today.

Carter: Perfect. Meeting adjourned.
